    <h1>Who doesn't love bugs?</h1>
<p>We all feel a sense of wonder and joy when discovering a new critter. Our site allows you to identify insedcts in your area so you can learn more about them. 

<h2>Using our site</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to successfully identity insects!</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look closely at your specimen- take note of colors, anatomy, and species.</li>
  <li>Select your region</li>
  <li>Filter search results by species (spiders, caterpillars, etc.)</li>
  <li>Browse! Take note of any photos that seem similar to your specimen to narrow down possiblities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What now?</h2>
<p>Now that you have (hopefully) identified your creepy crawly friend... what do you do now? If you still have the specimen, release it back where you found it. This step assures you are not harming the insect, and offers somebody else the opportunity to see them as well. We have provided you with the common and scientific names of each specimen you come across, as well as a brief description of them. If you please, you can find more information about the insect by simply searching the name in your web browser.</p>
